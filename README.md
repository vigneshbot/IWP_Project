# Online Book Store

The aim of this project is to create an Online Book Store that facilities users to review books and if interested, purchase books from the amazon.com website using the corresponding link provided. This website also supports login and register functionality. Books can be viewed in full detail (Synopsis, Author details etc.) and can be searched by Book Name, Author Name, or year. Additionally, books are also categories according to their genre (Fiction, Non-fiction, Educational etc.). The user will be directed to the Amazon page if they wish to purchase any book. The goal of Online Book Store is to enable book reading enthusiasts to easily find books they wish to read based on fellow readerâ€™s reviews. The project has been implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL.
