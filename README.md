# Online Book Store

The aim of this project is to create an Online Book Store that facilities users to review and purchase books. This website also supports login and signup functionality. Books can be viewed in full detail (Synopsis, Author details etc.) and can be searched by Book Name, Author Name, or year. Additionally, books are also categories according to their genre (Fiction, Non-fiction, Educational etc.). The user will be directed to the Amazon page if they wish to purchase any book. The goal of Online Book Store is to enable book reading enthusiasts to easily find books they wish to read based on fellow readerâ€™s reviews. The project has been implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL.
